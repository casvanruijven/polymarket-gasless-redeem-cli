## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** and npm (required)
- **Python 3.8+** (optional - only needed for `--interval` scheduling feature)
- **Polymarket Builder API credentials** (API key, secret, and passphrase)
- **Wallet private key** and **proxy wallet address** (Funder Address)

> 💡 **Note**: Python is optional. If you only need one-time redemptions or prefer to use cron/Task Scheduler for automation, you can use Node.js alone.

### Getting Your Credentials

You'll need 5 pieces of information:

| Credential | Where to Find It |
|------------|------------------|
| **Private Key** | Export from your wallet app (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) or Polymarket account settings (if using custodial wallet). This is the EOA wallet linked to your Polymarket account. |
| **Proxy Wallet Address** | Your Polymarket "Funder Address" - visible in your Polymarket deposit/withdraw page or account settings. This is NOT your EOA address. |
| **Builder API Key** | [Polymarket Settings → Builder Codes](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) - Create a new API key |
| **Builder API Secret** | Shown once when you create the API key (save it!) |
| **Builder API Passphrase** | You set this when creating the API key |

> ⚠️ **Important**: 
> - **Private Key**: Polymarket supports most crypto wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.). Export your private key from whichever wallet you connected to Polymarket. If you created a custodial wallet through Polymarket, export from your Polymarket account settings.
> - **Proxy Wallet Address**: This is your Polymarket-specific "Funder Address" (starts with `0x`), NOT your EOA wallet address. Find it in your Polymarket deposit/withdraw settings.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NocodeSolutions/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli.git
cd polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- `@polymarket/builder-relayer-client` - For gasless transactions
- `@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk` - For API signing
- `ethers` - Ethereum library
- `dotenv` - Environment variable management

### Step 3: Configure Encrypted Key Storage

Run the secure setup wizard to store your credentials:

```bash
node redeem.js --setup
```

The wizard will prompt you for:

| Prompt | What to Enter |
|--------|---------------|
| Wallet private key | Your EOA private key - export from your wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) or Polymarket account if using custodial wallet. Starts with `0x`. |
| Proxy wallet address | Your Polymarket Funder Address - starts with `0x` |
| Builder API key | From [Polymarket Builder Codes](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) |
| Builder API secret | The secret shown when you created the API key |
| Builder API passphrase | The passphrase you set when creating the API key |
| Encryption password | **Create a strong password** - you'll need this to run redemptions |

> 🔐 **Security**: Your credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored in `.encrypted_keys`. 
> - **One-time mode**: Password prompted each run
> - **Interval mode**: Password prompted once at startup, kept in memory for the session

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup Encrypted Keys (one-time)

```bash
node redeem.js --setup
```

### Step 2: Test Your Setup

Verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --check
# or: node redeem.js --check
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify your encrypted keys are set up
- ✅ Connect to Polymarket's API
- ✅ Check for redeemable positions
- ✅ Display results without redeeming

### Step 3: Run Your First Redemption

Once verified, run a one-time redemption:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --once
# or: node redeem.js
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Command-Line Options

```bash
python redeem_cli.py [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--interval MINUTES` | Run redemption automatically every N minutes |
| `--once` | Run redemption once and exit (default if --interval not specified) |
| `--check` | Only check for redeemable positions, don't actually redeem |
| `--help` | Show help message and exit |

### Usage Examples

#### One-Time Redemption

Redeem all available positions once and exit:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --once
```

#### Check Mode

Check for redeemable positions without redeeming:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --check
```

#### Automatic Redemption

Run redemption automatically every 15 minutes:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --interval 15
```

Run redemption automatically every hour:

```bash
python redeem_cli.py --interval 60
```

> 💡 **Note**: The CLI prompts for your encryption password once at startup. The password is kept in memory for the session, so interval mode works automatically without re-prompting.

#### Using Environment Variable (for scripts/services)

For fully automated operation (e.g., systemd service), you can set the password via environment variable:

```bash
export REDEEM_PASSWORD="your_encryption_password"
python redeem_cli.py --interval 15
```

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: Only use `REDEEM_PASSWORD` in secured environments. The password is stored in memory during execution.

#### Stop Automatic Service

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the service.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Encrypted Key Storage

Credentials are stored securely using encrypted key storage. Run `node redeem.js --setup` to configure.

### Optional Environment Variables

These environment variables can optionally override default settings:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RPC_URL` | Polygon RPC endpoint | `https://polygon-rpc.com` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) | `INFO` |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_REDEMPTIONS` | Max parallel redemptions | `3` |

### File Structure

```

```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

The CLI follows these steps:

1. **🔍 Fetch Positions** - Queries Polymarket's Data API for redeemable positions
2. **📊 Group by Condition** - Aggregates positions by condition ID
3. **🔨 Build Transactions** - Creates redemption transactions for each condition
4. **🚀 Submit Gasless** - Submits transactions via Polymarket's gasless relayer
5. **✅ Confirm & Log** - Waits for confirmation and logs results with PolygonScan links

### Supported Position Types

- **CTF (Conditional Tokens Framework)** - Binary markets with YES/NO outcomes
- **Negative Risk** - Markets with negative risk positions

### Architecture: Node.js vs Python

This tool has two components:

| Component | Language | Purpose | Required? |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `redeem.js` | Node.js | Core engine - handles all API calls, encryption, and transactions | ✅ **Yes** |
| `redeem_cli.py` | Python | Convenience wrapper - adds built-in `--interval` scheduling | ❌ **Optional** |

**Why Python?** The Python CLI was added for ease of use - it provides built-in interval scheduling without needing to configure cron jobs or Task Scheduler. If you're comfortable with system scheduling tools, you can use Node.js directly and skip Python entirely.

**Node.js Only (no Python needed):**
```bash
node redeem.js --check    # Check positions
node redeem.js            # Redeem positions
# Use cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for automation
```

**With Python (built-in scheduling):**
```bash
python redeem_cli.py --interval 15  # Runs every 15 minutes automatically
```

### Transaction Flow

## 🖥️ Running as a Service

> ⚠️ **Note**: For automated services, set the `REDEEM_PASSWORD` environment variable to avoid interactive password prompts.

### Linux/macOS (systemd)

Create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Polymarket Gasless Redeem CLI
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
Environment="PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin"
Environment="REDEEM_PASSWORD=your_encryption_password"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli/redeem_cli.py --interval 15
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: For production, consider using systemd's `EnvironmentFile` directive to load the password from a secured file with restricted permissions.

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
sudo systemctl start polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
sudo systemctl status polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
```

View logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli -f
```

### Using PM2 (Node.js Process Manager)

```bash
npm install -g pm2
REDEEM_PASSWORD="your_password" pm2 start redeem_cli.py --name polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli --interpreter python3 -- --interval 15
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Using Supervisor

Create `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli.conf`:

```ini
[program:polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli]
command=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli/redeem_cli.py --interval 15
directory=/path/to/polymarket-gasless-redeem-cli
user=your_user
environment=REDEEM_PASSWORD="your_encryption_password"
autostart=true

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ "Node.js is not installed or not in PATH"

**Solution:**
- Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Ensure `node` command is available in your PATH
- Restart your terminal after installation

#### ❌ "Encrypted keys not configured"

**Solution:**
- Run `node redeem.js --setup` to configure your credentials
- Follow the setup wizard to enter your wallet and API credentials
- Create a strong password to encrypt your keys

#### ❌ "Invalid password or corrupted key file"

**Solution:**
- Verify you're entering the correct encryption password
- If you forgot your password, delete `.encrypted_keys` and run setup again
- Ensure the key file hasn't been modified or corrupted

#### ❌ "Redemption script not found"

**Solution:**
- Ensure `redeem.js` is in the same directory as `redeem_cli.py`
- Check file permissions: `chmod +x redeem.js` (Linux/macOS)
- Verify you're running the command from the project root

#### ❌ "Script timed out"

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Polymarket API is accessible
- Service will retry automatically in automatic mode
- Increase timeout in `redeem_cli.py` if needed (default: 120 seconds)

#### ❌ "Failed to redeem positions"

**Solution:**
- Verify your Builder API credentials are correct
- Check your proxy wallet address is correct
- Ensure your wallet has sufficient balance (if needed)
- Check Polygon network status
- Review transaction on PolygonScan for error details

#### ❌ "No redeemable positions found"

**This is normal!** It means:
- All positions are already redeemed, or
- No positions have resolved yet, or
- Positions don't meet the minimum size threshold (0.01)

### Debug Mode

For more detailed logging, you can modify the logging level in `redeem_cli.py`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Change from INFO to DEBUG
    ...
)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 🔐 **Enhanced Security Features (v2.0)**

This version includes significant security improvements:

- **🔒 Encrypted Key Storage** - All sensitive data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **🛡️ Password Protection** - Keys are protected with PBKDF2-derived encryption keys
- **✅ Input Validation** - All inputs are validated before processing
- **🚦 Rate Limiting** - API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **🔄 Retry Logic** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for resilience
- **📊 Structured Logging** - Secure logging without exposing sensitive data

### Best Practices

- 🔐 **Never share your encryption password** or recovery keys
- 🚫 **Never commit `.encrypted_keys`** - It should be in `.gitignore`
- 🔍 **Start with `--check`** - Verify setup before redeeming
- 📊 **Monitor logs** - Regularly check for unexpected behavior
- 🔄 **Rotate credentials** - Change API keys and passwords periodically
- 🛡️ **Backup encrypted keys** - Store backups securely (password required to restore)
- 👀 **Review transactions** - Check PolygonScan before running in automatic mode
- 🔑 **Strong passwords** - Use complex passwords for key encryption

### Security Checklist

- [x] `.encrypted_keys` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Encryption password is strong (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [x] Private keys are never logged or printed
- [x] API credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- [ ] Service runs with minimal permissions
- [x] Logs don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] Regular security updates applied
- [ ] Encrypted keys are backed up securely

### Key Management

The system uses encrypted key storage instead of plain environment variables:

```bash
# First-time setup (Node.js - required once)
node redeem.js --setup
```

### Running Redemptions

**Option 1: Node.js (one-time only)**
```bash
node redeem.js --check    # Check positions
node redeem.js            # Redeem positions
```

**Option 2: Python CLI (supports intervals)**
```bash
python redeem_cli.py --check        # Check positions
python redeem_cli.py --once         # Redeem once
python redeem_cli.py --interval 15  # Redeem every 15 minutes
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Use **Python CLI** for scheduled/automatic redemption. Use **Node.js** for quick one-time operations.

**Benefits:**
- Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Password-based access control
- No plain-text credentials in files
- Automatic key validation
- Secure key rotation support
